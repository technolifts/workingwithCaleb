I resonded with this:

> Hello Caleb,

> I saw your post on LinkedIn and I am interested in this opportunity.

> ## 1. A brief overview of your cybersecurity experience and skills

> My interest in Cyber Security began at the University of Washington where I decided to take the Cyber Security Concentration track of my major. This track covered courses from Cyber Security fundamentals to networking to risk management.

> After college I joined Adobe as a Cyber Security Enablement Specialist. My focus on this role was making Adobe Security solutions trivial for the Adobe community (with a focus on the development community) to adopt. From diving into the lifecycle of a phish and providing recommended controls and desired human actions, to automated WAF onboarding. I also manage the Security Champion Program at Adobe, which allows us to scale security into each of the products.

> I have since done stretch projects and collaborated with the Red Team in tagging along on their operations and helping map their TTP's so blue could conduct a gap analysis on where they should have detected red, but did not. I also collaborated with the offensive security team with triaging potential vulnerabilities across the Adobe ecosystem by utilizing Nuclei.

> My most recent shift at work has been a collaboration with the team responsible for deploying WAF's across Adobe. I have done extensive data engineering work in this role.

> Outside of work I do CTF's on HackTheBox and TryHackMe as well as take TryHackMe courses. I'm also passionate about building in the cloud and have joined the board of the Cloud Security Alliance - Seattle Chapter. I maintain a blog where I discuss some of the CTF's I do and talk about security generally.

> I have a wide range of skills and have the ability to quickly adapt to new challenges, understand them deeply and build solutions.

> ### 2. One example of a security challenge you've tackled 

> I will touch on a core security concept regarding "You can't secure what you don't know". 
>
> At Adobe we have various different WAF vendors. Whenever we needed to check if a certain product has implemented a WAF or what a certain WAF rule is set to we had to either rely on tribal knowledge or spend time digging through each of the vendor consoles to dig for the answer. This is an extremely time consuming process that stopped us from having visibility into WAF posture at Adobe and act quick when we needed to. 
>
> As a result, I build a solution that pulled WAF configurations from vendor API's and performed transformations on that data as well as data that came from our automated WAF onboarding process and solution mapping data.
>
> This solution allowed us to answer high level questions about the WAF posture at Adobe and dig into the specifics about the WAF configurations at Adobe in a quick and efficient manner.
>
> Note: This solution is also leveraged by our Technology GRC team to help validate PCI compliance.  
>
>
> ### 3. Your preferred area of focus in cybersecurity (e.g., network security, threat analysis, appsec)
>
> - Application Security
> - Cloud Security
>
> I consider myself a builder. 
>
>
> ### 4. Your availability for short-term projects
>
> I am VERY available. I spend my free time on projects and learning.
> 
> Thank you for your consideration. I kept this brief, please reach out if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon,

From there I learned that Caleb was trying to build the next generation of "cyber security high acheivers". He wanted to take the hundreds of applications he received and boil them down to a small group of people to work together. Caleb had the ability to give us opportunities that could accelerate our career and learning, but he wanted to give it to the right people. Caleb led the application through a "interview process" by giving a takehome assignement in the form of a research paper and then an interview. 

## I was one of the junior professionals that was selected.

In this gitrepo I will document each of the project I do with Caleb and share my key learnings
