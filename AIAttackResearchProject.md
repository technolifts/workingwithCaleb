# AI Attack Research Project
In this project we were asked to do research on all security incidents related to AI and include the following information:
- categorize them by type
- if they were adversarial or research
- the target
- description
- impact
- source

# Takeaways
- Categorzing finding by "type of attack" forced me to learn a lot about each of the incidents which I enjoyed because it shows me real attack chains and TTP's.
- Reports of true breaches often lack detail. Why? Do they not perform RCA's, have they still not patched the vuln, or can they just not figure out what happened. I would like to explore this more. Can I reverse engineer an attack? Can AI reverse engineer an attack?

# What I could have done better
- I did not do a good enough job asking questions to understand what the ultimate goal of this was and how the tasks at hand would lead to that goal. If I understood the goal I could have provided my opinions in how best to acheive this goal.
- I didn't perform the task at hand how I would have by myself. Jenny and I work very differently. I like to be organized and methodical at each step of the way and Jenny employs a more hectic workstyle and brings is all in together at the end. At the beginning, I tried to work like Jenny, this didn't work. Luckily I caught myself.
- I could have been a better leader. This point ties into #1 but I feel I wasn't able to be a good leader in part because of this reason but also because I was trying to understand our dynamic. I was curious to see where Jenny would excel and where she would struggle. I think this led me to take more of a back seat and be less of a leader than I usually am.

# What I will do in the future
- Always understand the goal and how the work will lead to acheiving the goal.
- Operate in a team, independently and use strengths in the other persons workstyle to compliment mine.
- Do not be afraid to reevaluate the path forward
